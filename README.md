# UFO SIGHTINGS

## Overview of the Analysis
In this project, we have developed a webpage that has compiled the data of all of UFO sightings across North America. This wepage also allows the users to filter the data based on date, location and shape of the UFO.

## Results
This webpage enables users to filter the data based on certain criteria. It has input boxes that allow users to enter text to filter the data. 

Here is the screenshot of the filterbox on the webpage:

The user can enter one or multiple criteria in the filter box and press enter to see the filtered table.

Another feature of this webpage is that it also has a navigation bar at the top of the page that clears all the filters.

## Summary
- One of the drawbacks of this page is that it does not have further information or links to resources regarding sighting events.
- We can add another tab in the navigation bar for "contact-us" in event of any UFO-sighting so that we can update our data. 
- We can also add a bar graph on the webpage to show which state had the most UFO sightings.
